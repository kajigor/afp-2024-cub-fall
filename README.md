# Exam 

## 12:30-14:30, 11th of December 2024

Your task is to solve a programming problem while demonstrating your understanding of any two topics covered in our course. The list of the topics is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_z68GXJjpsro9KI9hSd6u-dvxRKDUWp5P9b2rD2tBig/edit?usp=sharing). 

Make sure your code compiles and tests pass if you have any. 
Unless you use stack, make sure to provide building and running instructions for your project. 

Grading policy: 

* 10 points for a solution to a problem that compiles and runs successfully. 
* 20 points for a successful demonstration of a topic, per topic.

You can get up to 50 points which convert into 50% of your final grade. 

## Problems 

* Design a data type to represent matrices and implement basic operations over them. 
* Design a domain-specific language to run queries to a database of your choice. 
* Design a data type for Markov chains and implement an evaluator for them. 
* Imagine, you have a fleet of fitness trackers which may operate in different units of measure. Collect statistics from them. 
* Implement a scientific calculator which supports not only basic arithmetic operations, but also some trigonometry and has a memory cell. 

I have chosen task 'Implement a scientific calculator which supports not only basic arithmetic operations, but also some trigonometry and has a memory cell.'.

I used Monad Transformers, GADT and DSL.
